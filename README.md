### 328. Odd Even Linked List
Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

**Example:**
Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL,
return 1->3->5->2->4->NULL.

**Note:**
The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...

### 197. Rising Temperature
Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

| Id(INT) | Date(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
| :-----: |   :----:   |      :----:      |
|       1 | 2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 | 2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 | 2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 | 2015-01-04 |               30 |

For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:

| Id |
|----|
|  2 |
|  4 |

### 326. Power of Three
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.

**Follow up:**
Could you do it without using any loop / recursion?

### 231. Power of Two
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.


### 292. Nim Game
You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.
Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.
For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.

### 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
|:--:|:-----:|:------:|:---------:|
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |

Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

| Employee |
|:--------:|
| Joe      |

###182. Duplicate Emails
Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

| Id | Email   |
|:--:|:-------:|
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

| Email   |
|:-------:|
| a@b.com |

**Note:** All emails are in lowercase.  

### 225. Implement Stack using Queues
Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.

push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
top() -- Get the top element.
empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.


**Notes:**
You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).

### 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

### 62. Unique Paths
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

![Example](http://articles.leetcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/robot_maze.png)

Above is a 3 x 7 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** m and n will be at most 100.

### 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
Given a binary tree

```cpp
struct TreeLinkNode {
      TreeLinkNode *left;
      TreeLinkNode *right;
      TreeLinkNode *next;
    }
```
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

**Note:**  
You may only use constant extra space.  
You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
For example,  
Given the following perfect binary tree,  
　　　　1  
　　　/ 　\   
　　2　　　 3  
　/　 \ 　　/　 \  
4 　　5 　6 　　7

After calling your function, the tree should look like:  
  　　　　　1 -> NULL  
　　　　/　 　 \  
　　　2 　->　 3 -> NULL  
　　/ 　\  　　　/ 　\  
　4　->　5->　6->　7 -> NULL  

### 1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example:**
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

### 100. Same Tree

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.

Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

### 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

### 155. Min Stack
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.  
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.  
top() -- Get the top element.  
getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.  


### 344. Reverse String
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

Example:
Given s = "hello", return "olleh".


### 338. Counting Bits
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example:
For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].

Follow up:
It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

### 191. Number of 1 Bits
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

### 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### 226. Invert Binary Tree

```
     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9

to
```
     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
```

### 283. Move Zeroes
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

*Note:*
You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.

### 349. Intersection of Two Arrays
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example:
Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2].

*Note:*
Each element in the result must be unique.
The result can be in any order.

### 237. Delete Node in a Linked List
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

### 100. Same Tree
Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.
Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

### 7. Reverse Integer
Reverse digits of an integer.
Example1: x = 123, return 321
Example2: x = -123, return -321

### 8. String to Integer (atoi)
mplement atoi to convert a string to an integer.
*Hint:* Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.
*Notes:* It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front.

### 9. Palindrome Number
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

### 13. Roman to Integer
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

### 14. Longest Common Prefix
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

*Examples:*
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

### 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,
   Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
   After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
*Note:*
Given n will always be valid.
Try to do this in one pass.

### 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
Given a digit string, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.
A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below.

![Example](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Telephone-keypad2.svg/200px-Telephone-keypad2.svg.png)

```
Input:Digit string "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].
```
*Note:*
Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.

### 20. Valid Parentheses
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
The brackets must close in the correct order, "()" and "()[]{}" are all valid but "(]" and "([)]" are not.

### 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

### 6. ZigZag Conversion
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:
```
string convert(string text, int nRows);
```
convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".

### 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.
For example,
Given input array nums = [1,1,2],
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

### 27. Remove Element
Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example:**
Given input array `nums = [3,2,2,3]`, `val = 3`

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

### 28. Implement strStr()
Implement strStr().

Returns the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

### 36. Valid Sudoku
Determine if a Sudoku is valid, according to: Sudoku Puzzles - The Rules.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg/250px-Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg.png)

A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

**Note:**
A valid Sudoku board (partially filled) is not necessarily solvable. Only the filled cells need to be validated.

### 15. 3Sum
Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

**Note:**The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
···
For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
···

### 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

For example,
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.

Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.

### 260. Single Number III
Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

For example:

Given nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5], return [3, 5].

**Note:**
The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.

Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

### 238. Product of Array Except Self
Given an array of n integers where n > 1, nums, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Solve it without division and in O(n).

For example, given [1,2,3,4], return [24,12,8,6].

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (Note: The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

### 242. Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

For example,
s = "anagram", t = "nagaram", return true.
s = "rat", t = "car", return false.

**Note:**
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

**Follow up:**
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?
